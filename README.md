# TDR-waveform-analysis-for-incomplete-sensor-insertion
This repository contains the original waveform data from partial depths of vertical insertions in the lab for different mediums. It also includes the programs in R that were used to present in the paper to encourage future replications. 
TDR Snapview raw data folder contains all the raw data from the lab for each depth of insertion in a.csv format file.
TDR Snapview data for R contains all the files that were used in R to calculate the derivatives. 305N_automation_finite_difference_method.R was used to calculate the derivatives.
TDR Snapview with derivatives contains all the files for all mediums with derivatives, which was used in TDR waveform analysis.
Water, Methanol, and Fully saturated soil use high_permittivity_TDR_waveform_analysis_paper_code.R for TDR waveform analysis. Please follow the instructions provided in the code.
For all other mediums, use the low_permittivity_TDR_waveform_analysis_code_for_paper.R. 
If you are facing any issues in accessing the data or using the code, please reach out to maxiamacap09@gmail.com
